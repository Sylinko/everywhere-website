We are committed to maintaining the spirit of open source while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the project. Therefore, this project uses the BSL 1.1 license.

## Quick Overview

Here are the key points of the license:
* **✅ You may:** use Everywhere for personal learning, internal use, non-commercial research, and **deployment within your company** free of charge.
* **❌ You may not:** provide competitive commercial hosting services based on Everywhere without authorization from Sylinko Inc. (e.g., directly selling a cloud-hosted version of Everywhere).
* **Eventually open source:** Each version of this project will automatically convert to the **Apache License 2.0** after **4 years** from its release, becoming fully open source software.

## FAQ

### Can I use Everywhere in a production environment within my company?
**Yes.** As long as you are not directly reselling Everywhere's functionality as a service (SaaS/PaaS) to your customers, internal business process use within your company is completely free and allowed.

### What is Competing Use?
Simply put, if you build a product or service whose core value is providing all or part of Everywhere's functionality and profit from it, it is considered competition.
* **❌ Violation example:** Setting up an "Everywhere Cloud Platform" that charges users to log in and use the software.
* **✅ Compliant example:** You use Everywhere's technology to process internal data in your e-commerce system, and your customers pay for the goods, not for Everywhere's functionality.

### What if I need to do commercial secondary development?
