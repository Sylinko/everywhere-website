This chapter will detail how to configure and use each supported model provider.

## Official Support

All model providers listed in the sidebar of this chapter are maintained and supported by the Everywhere team. We are committed to ensuring that the integration of these providers with Everywhere runs stably and efficiently.

## Provider Inclusion

To optimize development resources and ensure the best user experience, our development team makes a subjective assessment when choosing which model providers to support. The evaluation criteria include, but are not limited to, the provider's reputation, market popularity, and community feedback.

Rest assured, the list of officially supported model providers will not change frequently to ensure service stability.

## Regarding Third-Party Services

Please note that Everywhere only provides technical support for officially and directly supported model providers. Due to the significant development time required for compatibility adaptation, we cannot handle any issues arising from the use of third-party transit or proxy APIs.

If you encounter any issues while using a supported model provider, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/DearVa/Everywhere/issues) for assistance.
