This tutorial will guide you step-by-step on how to get an API key for [Moonshot (Kimi)](https://moonshot.kimi.ai).

<Callout type="warning">

## Steps

- Go to the [Moonshot Open Platform](https://platform.moonshot.cn/playground) and register & log in to your account.
- After logging in, click the icon in the top-left corner to bring up the sidebar.

  />

- Click the **创建 API Key** button in the top-right corner of the page. A dialog box will pop up:
- Enter a name for your API key in the top input field to help you remember its purpose.
- Below, select the project for the API key. For new accounts, this is usually `default`.

- Click the **确定** button, and your API key will be displayed. Copy this key.

Please be sure to save your API key properly, as it will only be displayed once. If you accidentally close the dialog box, you can generate a new key on the API keys page and delete the old key that you forgot to save.

Please note that the API key is sensitive information. Do not disclose it to anyone or share it in public.
