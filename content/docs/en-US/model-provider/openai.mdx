This tutorial will guide you step-by-step on how to obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com).

Please note that subscribing to paid plans such as ChatGPT Plus, Team or Pro is billed separately from the API service. You may still need to pay separately for API usage.

## Preparation

- A valid email address for account registration
- An international mobile phone number for account security verification
- If you need to use OpenAI API's paid services, you will also need a valid international credit card

## Steps

- [Register for an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) using your prepared email address and mobile number.
- After logging in, visit the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and click the `"Create new secret key"` button.

<Callout type="warning">
Please be sure to save your API key properly, as it will only be displayed once. If you accidentally close the dialog box, you can generate a new key on the API keys page and delete the old key that you forgot to save.
