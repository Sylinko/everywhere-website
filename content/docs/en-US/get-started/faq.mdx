## Payments

### I subscribed to ChatGPT Plus/Team/Pro or a similar service, why am I being told my balance is insufficient?

ChatGPT Plus/Team/Pro or Google AI Pro subscription services are billed separately from the API services.

**You need to top up your balance for the API services separately.**

## Model Providers

### How to configure models when using a gateway provider (like OpenRouter)?

For example, if you are using the `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` model within OpenRouter:

### Why isn't my (unofficially supported) model provider working?

**Everywhere** supports a range of major model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek). **For these officially supported providers, we strive to ensure their compatibility and stability.**

However, there are many third-party or self-hosted model services that are compatible with the OpenAI API format. **Due to limited resources, we cannot test and adapt to all unofficially supported model providers.** If you encounter issues while using an unofficially supported provider, we recommend that you first contact the service provider for technical support or switch to an officially supported one.

### The AI gives no response

If there is no response after asking a question (but status messages like **Analyze Context** are displayed), it might be due to an incorrect API Url configuration.

For example, a common mistake is entering `https://api.openai.com` instead of `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

<Callout type="tip" title="How to find the correct API Url">
1. If your model service provider is on **Everywhere**'s official support list, please keep the default Url.
2. If you are using a third-party or self-hosted service, please refer to its official documentation to find the correct API Url (also known as "Endpoint").

   For an OpenAI-compatible API, you need to find an address like `https://api.example.com/v1/chat/completions`, then remove the `/chat/completions` part at the end to get `https://api.example.com/v1`, and enter this into the `API Url` field in **Everywhere**.

### Why can't I use web search?

You may have noticed that when using services like ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek on their official websites, they have web search capabilities. This is because the providers' websites have integrated search functionality, which then combines the search results with the large language model to provide you with answers that include the latest information.

However, when we call these large language models via API, we are using their core text generation function, which does not include web search.

**Everywhere** interacts with these models via API. Therefore, to enable web search, you need an external search engine service (e.g., Google, Brave, Tavily, Bocha). You need to configure the corresponding search engine service in **Everywhere** to allow the AI to have web search capabilities when answering questions.

## Software Usage

### Why can't I bring up the floating chat window?

If you press the hotkey but don't see the **Everywhere** floating window, there are usually two possible reasons:
1. **Hotkey Conflict**: The hotkey you set may be the same as another software on your system (e.g., screenshot tool, input method).
  * **Solution**: Try changing the hotkey in **Everywhere**'s `Chat Settings` and try again.
2. **Administrator Permissions**: When you are active in a window running with administrator privileges (e.g., Task Manager, some installers), **Everywhere** also needs to run with administrator privileges to display on top of that window. This is due to Windows' User Account Control (UAC) mechanism, which uses "Integrity Levels" to isolate programs with different permissions, preventing lower-privilege applications from controlling higher-privilege ones.
  * **Solution**: In **Everywhere**'s `General Settings`, click the `Restart as Administrator` button and try again.
