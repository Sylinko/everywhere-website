You can manage and configure your AI assistants through the **AI Assistant** page in the sidebar of the Everywhere main interface.

## Settings

<Callout type="info" title="Check Connectivity">
When configuring an AI assistant, you can use the **Check Connectivity** button in the upper right corner of the page to verify if the entered API information is correct and if the network environment is available.

If the check fails, please verify the AI provider-related settings, or try switching to a different network environment.
</Callout>

### Basic Info

#### Icon

You can set a custom icon for each assistant to make it easier to distinguish between different assistants in the sidebar.

Click on the icon area to select a Lucide icon or some Emoji as the assistant's icon. You can also modify the icon and background color.

#### Name

Give the assistant an easily recognizable name to facilitate switching between multiple assistants.

#### Description

Add a short description to the assistant to help you remember its purpose or features.

### System Prompt

The system prompt is used to guide the AI assistant's behavior and response style. You can customize the system prompt as needed to make the assistant better suit your requirements.

<Callout type="info" title="Placeholders">
We provide some placeholders that you can use in the system prompt to dynamically insert relevant information:
- `{Time}`: Current time
- `{OS}`: Current operating system name
- `{SystemLanguage}`: System language *consistent with the Everywhere interface language*
- `{WorkingDirectory}`: Current working directory path *usually a folder named with the current date under the `plugins` folder*
</Callout>

**Default System Prompt Example**
```markdown
You are a helpful assistant named "Everywhere", a precise and contextual digital assistant.
You are able to assist users with various tasks directly on their computer screens.
Visual context is crucial for your functionality, can be provided in the form of a visual tree structure representing the UI elements on the screen (If available).
You can perceive and understand anything on your screen in real time. No need for copying or switching apps. Users simply press a shortcut key to get the help they need right where they are.

<SystemInformation>
OS: {OS}
Current time: {Time}
Language: {SystemLanguage}
Working directory: {WorkingDirectory}
</SystemInformation>

<FormatInstructions>
Always keep your responses concise and to the point.
Do NOT mention the visual tree or your capabilities unless the user asks about them directly.
Do not use HTML or mermaid diagrams in your responses since the Markdown renderer may not support them.
Reply in System Language except for tasks such as translation or user specifically requests another language.
</FormatInstructions>

<FunctionCallingInstructions>
Functions can be dynamic and may change at any time. Always refer to the latest tool list provided in the tool call instructions.
NEVER print out a codeblock with arguments to run unless the user asked for it. If you cannot make a function call, explain why (Maybe the user forgot to enable it?).
When writing files, prefer letting them inside the working directory unless absolutely necessary. Prohibit writing files to system directories unless explicitly requested by the user.
</FunctionCallingInstructions>
```

### Configure AI Provider

You can choose between **Preset Mode** or **Advanced Mode** based on the level of customization you need.

<Callout type="warning">
Please ensure that the AI provider you choose supports the features you intend to use, such as tool usage or image input, to avoid request failures.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Privacy">
Please note that API keys are sensitive information. Do not disclose them to anyone or share them in public places.
</Callout>

#### Preset Mode

In Preset Mode, you only need to fill in common configuration options. The system will automatically complete other settings based on the selected model provider, suitable for most users.

- **Model Provider**  
  Select the model provider you want to use from the dropdown menu. The system will automatically fill in the relevant API call address and protocol based on the selected provider.
- **API Key**  
  Select your previously saved API key from the dropdown menu, or add a new API key.
- **Model Name**  
  Select the specific model name you want to use from the dropdown menu. For example, for OpenAI, you can choose `GPT 5`.

#### Advanced Mode

In Advanced Mode, you can customize more configuration options, suitable for users with specific needs or those using model providers not officially supported.

- **URL**  
  Enter the API call address of the model provider.
- **API Key**  
  Select your previously saved API key from the dropdown menu, or add a new API key.
- **API Schema**  
  Select the API protocol corresponding to the model provider you are using. Different protocols may affect the format and parameters of the request.
- **Model ID**  
  Enter the specific model ID you want to use. For example, for OpenAI, you can enter `gpt-5-mini`.
- **Image Input Support**  
  Enable this option to upload images in the chat context. **If the model does not support image input, enabling this option may cause request failures.**
- **Tool Usage Support**  
  Enable this option to allow the model to use the tools (plugins) you have configured. **If the model does not support tool usage, enabling this option may cause request failures.**
- **Deep Thinking Support**  
  Enable this option to allow the model to think before answering. **If the model does not support deep thinking, enabling this option may cause request failures.**
- **Maximum Context Length**  
  Set the maximum context length (in tokens) the model can use in a conversation. Please adjust according to the limitations of the model you are using.

### Request Timeout

Set the timeout for each API request in seconds. If a request is not completed within this time, it will be terminated. For slower models, it is recommended to increase the timeout duration appropriately.

### Creativity (Temperature)

Adjust the creativity of the model's generated responses. A higher value (e.g., 0.8) will make the responses more diverse and creative, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) will make them more conservative and consistent.

### Thought Openness (Top-P)

Adjust the range of vocabulary the model considers when generating responses. A higher value (e.g., 0.9) will make the model consider more vocabulary options, while a lower value (e.g., 0.3) will restrict the model to only the most likely words.

### Expression Divergence (Presence Penalty)

Adjust the model's tendency to introduce new topics in its responses. A higher value (e.g., 0.6) will encourage the model to introduce more new topics, while a lower value (e.g., -0.6) will make the model more inclined to repeat existing topics.

### Vocabulary Richness (Frequency Penalty)

Adjust the model's tendency to repeat the same words in its responses. A higher value (e.g., 0.6) will reduce the use of repeated words, while a lower value (e.g., -0.6) will allow for more repetition.
