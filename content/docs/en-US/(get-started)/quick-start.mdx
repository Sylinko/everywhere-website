    When you run Everywhere for the first time, you will see the welcome page.

  <Step>
    Click the **Let's start!** button and choose your AI model provider setup mode.  
    Here, We use the **Preset Mode** as an example:
    - **Preset Mode**: Only fill in common configuration items. Everywhere will complete other settings based on the selected model provider, suitable for most users.
    - **Advanced Mode**: Allows you to customize more configuration items, suitable for users with specific needs or using unofficially supported model providers.

    ![Choose Model Provider](/get-started/use/en-US/welcome-page-2.webp)

    <Callout type="warning" title="Other Model Providers">
    If the model provider you want to use is not available in Preset Mode, please switch to Advanced Mode.  
    For more information, please refer to the <DynamicLink href="/[lang]/docs/faq">FAQ</DynamicLink>.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In Preset Mode, you need to:
    - Select a supported model provider.
    - Create a new API Key or select a previously saved API Key.
    - Choose the model name.

    ![Enter API Key](/get-started/use/en-US/welcome-page-3.webp)

    <Callout type="info" title="Payment and Acquisition">
    Most model providers' APIs require paid calls. Please ensure you have obtained a valid API Key and have sufficient balance in your account. Also, subscriptions and API services for each provider are billed separately, so subscribing to a service does not mean you can use its API for free.

    You can refer to the <DynamicLink href="/[lang]/docs/model-provider">Model Providers</DynamicLink> section to learn how to obtain API Keys for each model provider.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning" title="Network Environment">
    For some model providers including OpenAI, you may not be able to directly access their API services. If you encounter network errors when verifying the API Key, please try using other models or set up a proxy or relay service.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="error" title="Privacy">
    Please note that API keys are sensitive information. Do not disclose them to anyone or share them in public places.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After completing the configuration items, please click the **Test Assistant Availability** button. If everything goes well, you will see a ribbon animation, and you can click **Next step**:
