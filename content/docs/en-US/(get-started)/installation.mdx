## Windows Installation Instructions

You can download either the installer (`.exe`) or the portable version (`.zip`). The two versions differ only in their packaging method.

- The installer filename is `Everywhere-Windows-x64-Setup-v<version number>.exe`. After downloading, you need to double-click to run the setup wizard. If you encounter a UAC (User Account Control) prompt, please select "Yes" to allow the installer to continue running.
- The portable filename is `Everywhere-Windows-x64-v<version number>.zip`. After downloading, you need to unzip the file into a folder, then directly run the `Everywhere.Windows.exe` inside.

<Callout type="info" title="Data Storage Location">
Regardless of whether you use the installer or the portable version, Everywhere's user data (such as settings, chat history, etc.) is stored in the user's application data directory, typically located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Everywhere`.
