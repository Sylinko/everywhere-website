<Callout type="tip">
Please note that even if this plugin is not enabled, Everywhere will attempt to retrieve the visual tree if a visual element is included when sending a message in the chat window. This plugin only provides additional functions.
</Callout>

## Features

This plugin provides three additional capabilities:

- Capture UI Element
- Capture Full Screen
- Operate UI Elements

## Notes

### Manipulating UI Elements

The decision to execute UI manipulation actions is up to the large model. **Typically, models may be reluctant to perform such actions**, and the results can sometimes be unsatisfactory.

### Software Compatibility

Since the visual tree is obtained via UI automation, **content cannot be retrieved from software that does not support accessibility features (such as WeChat)**. Additionally, applications like games are not supported.

### Real-time

The visual tree acquisition works like a snapshot rather than a real-time stream, so tasks like real-time YouTube subtitle translation are not possible.
