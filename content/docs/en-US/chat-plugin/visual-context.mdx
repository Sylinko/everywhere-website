<Callout type="tip">
Even if this plugin is not enabled, Everywhere will attempt to retrieve the visual context if a visual element is included when sending a message in the chat window. This plugin only provides additional functions.
</Callout>

## Functions

| Function | Description | Permission |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| List Windows | Lists all windows on the screen. | Read Screen |
| Capture UI Element | Capture a screenshot of a visual element. | Read Screen |
| Automate Actions | Execute a set of automated actions, such as clicks, inputs, or sending shortcuts. | Access Screen |

## Notes

### Automate Actions

<Callout type="warning">
The "Automate Actions" feature is **experimental** and may not work as expected. Use it with caution.
</Callout>

The decision to execute actions on UI elements is determined by the large model itself. In most cases, **the model may be reluctant to perform such actions**, and the execution results may sometimes be unsatisfactory.

### Software Compatibility

Since the visual context is obtained via UI automation, **content cannot be retrieved from software that does not support accessibility features (such as WeChat)**. Additionally, applications like games are not supported.

### Real-time Capability

The visual context acquisition works like a snapshot rather than a real-time stream, so tasks like real-time YouTube subtitle translation are not possible.
