## 1. Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how **Sylinko Inc.** ("we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and web beacons) when you visit our websites, including our **Documentation Site** and **Sylinko Passport** (collectively, the "Websites").

This policy provides you with clear information about the cookies we use and your choices regarding these technologies.

## 2. What are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

We use two main types of cookies:

* **Session Cookies:** These are temporary cookies that expire when you close your browser.
* **Persistent Cookies:** These remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them.

We also use **"Similar Technologies"** such as **Local Storage** (used to store your theme preferences, like "Dark Mode") which function similarly to cookies but store data in your browser for longer periods.

## 3. How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for the following purposes:

1. **Authentication & Security:** To identify you when you log in to Sylinko Passport and to protect our services from malicious attacks (e.g., bot attacks).
2. **Functionality:** To remember your preferences, such as your language settings or theme (Light/Dark mode).
3. **Performance & Analytics:** To understand how our Websites are used, detect errors, and improve system stability.

## 4. Cookies We Use

Below is a detailed list of the cookies and technologies we use on our Websites:
