## Agreement to Our Legal Terms
We are Sylinko Inc. ("Company," "we," "us," "our"), a company aiming to bridge human intent and digital action through intelligent software.

We operate the website sylinko.com (the "Site"), the application Everywhere (the "Software"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

A context-aware AI assistant for your desktop. Ready to respond intelligently, seamlessly integrating multiple LLMs and MCP tools.

You can contact us by email at [contact@sylinko.com](mailto:contact@sylinko.com).

These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and Sylinko Inc., concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

We may update this agreement from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this agreement frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

**Minimum age.** You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required in your country to consent to use the Services. If you are under 18 you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Services.

## 1. Our Services
The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA, FISMA), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services.

**The Services and Software are protected by a commercial license and are not purely open-source software.**

## 2. Content & Intellectual Property

### Our Intellectual Property
We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in our Services, including all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics in the Services (collectively, the "Content"), as well as the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the "Marks").

Our Content and Marks are protected by copyright and trademark laws (and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws) and treaties in the United States and around the world.

The Content and Marks are provided in or through the Services "AS IS" for your personal, non-commercial use or internal business purpose only.

### Your Content (Input & Output)
"Input" means any text, image, or other data you provide to the Services. "Output" means the text, image, or other data generated by the Services in response to your Input.

As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input. Subject to your compliance with these Legal Terms, we hereby assign to you all our right, title and interest in and to Output. You are responsible for Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Legal Terms.

**No Model Training.** We do not use your Input or Output to train or improve our AI models unless you explicitly opt-in to share such data for product improvement purposes. Your data remains yours, and we prioritize your privacy and data sovereignty.

### Feedback & Contributions
We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvements to the Services ("Feedback"). You may submit Feedback by contacting us (see Section 24) or through the feedback functionality in the Services.

By submitting Feedback, you grant to us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof).

## 4. User Registration

You may be required to register to use the Services. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.

**Account Security & Sharing.** You are prohibited from sharing your account credentials or providing access to your account to any third party. You may not sell, trade, or transfer your account to another person. Sylinko Inc. reserves the right to terminate accounts that exhibit suspicious patterns of concurrent access from multiple locations or devices that suggest account sharing.

## 5. Purchases and Payment

We use third-party payment processors (e.g. Stripe) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services.

You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made via the Services. You further agree to promptly update account and payment information, including email address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed. Sales tax will be added to the price of purchases as deemed required by us. We may change prices at any time.

You agree to pay all charges at the prices then in effect for your purchases, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon placing your order. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we have already requested or received payment.

We reserve the right to refuse any order placed through the Services. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same payment method, and/or orders that use the same billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.

## 6. Subscriptions

### Billing and Renewal
Your subscription will continue and automatically renew unless canceled. You consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until such time as you cancel the applicable order. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription plan you choose when you subscribed to the Services.

### Free Trial
We offer a 7-day free trial to new users who register with the Services. You will not be charged after the free trial ends unless you choose to subscribe to a paid plan.

### Cancellation
You can cancel your subscription at any time by logging into your account. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current paid term.

### Connectivity and Refunds
You are responsible for ensuring that your network environment allows access to the Services and any third-party providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). We are not responsible for any inability to access the Services due to your local network restrictions, firewalls, or government censorship. Such connectivity issues do not constitute grounds for a refund.

### Fee Changes
We may, from time to time, make changes to the subscription fee and will communicate any price changes to you in accordance with applicable law.

## 7. Software and Licensing

### Business Source License (BSL 1.1)
The software provided in connection with our Services, including the "Everywhere" desktop application (the "Software"), is licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)**. The full text of the license, including specific "Additional Use Grants" and the "Change License" date, can be found in [the LICENSE file](https://github.com/Sylinko/Everywhere/blob/main/LICENSE) in our GitHub repository.

### Scope of License
The Software is "Source-Available," meaning the source code is visible and available for inspection, auditing, and modification. However, it is **NOT** "Open Source" software (as defined by the OSI) until the Change Date specified in the LICENSE file.

- **Individual Use:** As defined in the "Additional Use Grant" of the BSL, individuals (including freelancers and solopreneurs) may typically use the Software for personal or professional purposes, provided such use does not violate the Commercial Use restrictions.
- **Commercial Use:** Use of the Software within a company, enterprise, or organization for internal business purposes, or offering the Software as a service to third parties (SaaS), constitutes "Commercial Use" and requires a paid Commercial Subscription or License from Sylinko. **You are strictly prohibited from using the Software to build a competing SaaS product or service.**

### Precedence
In the event of any conflict between these Legal Terms and the BSL license file located in the Software repository, the terms of the BSL license shall prevail regarding the use of the Software source code.

### Open Source Components
The Software may include third-party open-source software components ("OSS Components"). These OSS Components remain subject to their original open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). The BSL restrictions apply to the Sylinko Application code, not to the standalone OSS Components.

## 8. Prohibited Activities

You may not access or use the Services for any purpose other than that for which we make them available. As a user of the Services (including the Software and our subscription-based AI features), you agree not to:

**2. Service Integrity & Security**
- Attempt to bypass, disable, or circumvent any security measures, rate limits, or billing/licensing mechanisms implemented in the Services.
- Access the Services through any unauthorized interface or "wrapper" that attempts to hide usage patterns or evade subscription fees.
- Engage in activities that place an undue burden on our infrastructure, including the repetitive or high-volume use of AI API features that exceeds reasonable individual or business usage.
- Upload or transmit viruses, Trojan horses, or any code designed to disrupt the Software or our servers.

**3. License & Commercial Boundaries**

**4. Automated Abuse**
- Use bots, scripts, or scrapers to systematically extract data from our website/platform or to automate the creation of accounts.
- Sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your Sylinko account or API access to third parties.

## 9. Third-Party Integrations & Accounts

### Linking Accounts
As part of the functionality of the Services (including the use of Model Context Protocol "MCP" tools), you may link your account with online accounts you have with third-party service providers (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, Notion, X/Twitter) (each such account, a "Third-Party Account"). You may do this by providing your Third-Party Account login information through the Services or allowing us (and the installed Software) to access your Third-Party Account via API keys or OAuth.

If you provide your own API keys (e.g., OpenAI API Key), you are responsible for any usage costs billed by the third-party provider, and for ensuring your use complies with their policies. Sylinko Inc. is not liable if your API key is banned due to your usage patterns via our Software.

### Authority and Scope
By granting us or the Software access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand and agree that:
- **Access & Processing:** We may access, read, process, and ingest content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account ("Third-Party Content") so that it is available to the AI models for context awareness and response generation.
- **Agentic Actions:** The Services may, based on your instructions and the capabilities of the specific MCP tool, perform actions on your behalf within the Third-Party Account (e.g., creating documents, sending messages, modifying code, or deleting files). **You are solely responsible for all actions taken by the Services within your Third-Party Accounts.**

### Disclaimers
You represent and warrant that you are entitled to grant us access to your Third-Party Account without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account. We are not responsible for any Third-Party Content accessed or any changes made to your Third-Party Accounts by the Services. You acknowledge that if a Third-Party Account becomes unavailable or our access is terminated by the third-party provider, the related context-aware features may no longer function.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review any Third-Party Content for accuracy, legality, or non-infringement.

## 10. Third-Party Websites, Content and AI Models
The Services may contain (or you may be sent via the Site or App) links to other websites ("Third-Party Websites") as well as articles, photographs, text, graphics, pictures, designs, music, sound, video, information, applications, software, and other content or items belonging to or originating from third parties ("Third-Party Content"). Such Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Content are not investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Third-Party Websites accessed through the Services or any Third-Party Content posted on, available through, or installed from the Services, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices, or other policies of or contained in the Third-Party Websites or the Third-Party Content. Inclusion of, linking to, or permitting the use or installation of any Third-Party Websites or any Third-Party Content does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by us. If you decide to leave the Services and access the Third-Party Websites or to use or install any Third-Party Content, you do so at your own risk, and you should be aware these Legal Terms no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any website to which you navigate from the Services or relating to any applications you use or install from the Services. Any purchases you make through Third-Party Websites will be through other websites and from other companies, and we take no responsibility whatsoever in relation to such purchases which are exclusively between you and the applicable third party. You agree and acknowledge that we do not endorse the products or services offered on Third-Party Websites and you shall hold us blameless from any harm caused by your purchase of such products or services. Additionally, you shall hold us blameless from any losses sustained by you or harm caused to you relating to or resulting in any way from any Third-Party Content or any contact with Third-Party Websites.

The Services may integrate with or rely on third-party AI models and services (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). We do not control these third-party services and are not responsible for any service interruptions, downtime, or errors caused by them. You acknowledge that the availability and performance of the Services may be affected by the status of these third-party providers, and we shall not be liable for any such disruptions.

**Upstream Policy Compliance.** Users of our API services must comply with the usage policies of our upstream providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). Any violation of these policies that causes harm, suspension, or termination to our upstream accounts will result in immediate termination of your access to the Services and potential indemnity claims against you for damages incurred.

## 11. Artificial Intelligence Disclaimers and Usage

### Accuracy Warning
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.

### Use Restrictions
You may not use the Services to generate content that provides medical advice, legal advice, or financial advice. The Services are not a substitute for professional advice. You may not use the Output to develop models that compete with the Services or the underlying third-party models.

### Local Data Processing
The Software may process sensitive data locally on your machine (e.g., reading files, analyzing screen content). You are responsible for configuring the Software’s access permissions and ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently sent to third-party AI models via the Services. We are not liable for data leaks resulting from misconfigured permissions or user-initiated transmission of sensitive data to third-party models.

### No Liability for Underlying Models
The Services act as a desktop assistant interface that integrates various third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools. We do not control the generation process of these third-party models. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, or safety of the content generated by these third-party models, nor for their availability.

## 12. Services Management
We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to: (1) monitor the Services for violations of these Legal Terms; (2) take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates the law or these Legal Terms, including without limitation, reporting such user to law enforcement authorities; and (3) otherwise manage the Services in a manner designed to protect our rights and property and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Services.

## 13. Privacy Policy
We care about data privacy and security. Please review our <DynamicLink href="/[lang]/privacy">Privacy Policy</DynamicLink>. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Legal Terms. Please be advised the Services are hosted in the United States. If you access the Services from any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United States, then through your continued use of the Services, you are transferring your data to the United States, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States.

## 14. Term and Termination
These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE LEGAL TERMS OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION.

We cannot guarantee the Services will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Services, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Services at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Services during any downtime or discontinuance of the Services.

These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

## 17. Dispute Resolution

### Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

### Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration will take place in Kent, Delaware.

### Class Action Waiver
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

### Exceptions
The following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
